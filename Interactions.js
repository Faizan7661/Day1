// Interactions

// let’s see a couple of functions to interact with the user: alert, prompt and confirm.

// 1) alert => This one we’ve seen already. It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”. For example:

alert("Hello");

// 2) prompt => It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.

prompt("Hi")

// 3) Confirm => The function confirm shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel. The result is true if OK is pressed and false otherwise.

confirm("Are you the boss?");
