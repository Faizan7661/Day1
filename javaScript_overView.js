What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,clickable buttons,
popup menus, etc.). 

What can in-browser JavaScript do?

1) Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
2) React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
3) Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
4) Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
5) Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).


What makes JavaScript unique?

1) Full integration with HTML/CSS.
2) Simple things are done simply.
3) Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.

JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things. That’s what makes JavaScript unique.
